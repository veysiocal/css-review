<!-- There is 3 types of adding CSS. One of them inline. But this approach actually is not recommended because if you
create a bigger page with many styles, it quickly becaomes very hard to understand and read your code because your
style is always applied to the element you want to change. If ı want to change that ı should find element. Additionally,
if ı have like 10 different properties you want to change you get very long list of properties you assign here and 
that also hart to read. There is a better way of writing css: SELECTORS.
